# Access Tokens

Access tokens allow you to make calls programatically to the Yaade-Server. They are used to authenticate your requests. Access tokens are generated by the Yaade-Server and can be revoked at any time.

## Create an Access Token

To create an access token, go to the **⚙️ > Tokens** tab. Click on the **Create** button. You can specify a name for the token. This name is only used for your reference. The token itself is a long string of characters. You can copy the token to your clipboard by clicking on the copy icon.

## Use the Access Token

To use the access token, you have to add it to the `Authorization` header of your request. The header should look like this:

```
Authorization: Bearer yaade_<your-access-token>
```

## Revoke an Access Token

To revoke an access token go to the list of your access tokens and click on the delete button.
